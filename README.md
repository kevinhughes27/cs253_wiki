cs253_wiki
==========

This is the final version of the wiki I programmed for Udacity's CS 253 course with Steve Huffman. The course is online and free at https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253 and comes highly recommended from me!

I wrote all of python code and HTML templates but most of the css was provided by the course. This code is slightly different than my first attempt because I incorporated elements from Steve's solution after finishing the final.
